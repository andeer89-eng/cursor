# Performance Analysis and Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

This report details comprehensive performance optimizations applied to two Python scripts: a volume screener and a trading bot. The optimizations focus on reducing execution time, memory usage, and API call efficiency while improving scalability and error handling.

## Original Performance Issues Identified

### Volume Screener Script (`Volume screener`)
1. **Sequential API Calls**: Processed stocks one by one, causing 20+ seconds execution time
2. **Redundant Data Fetching**: Downloaded full 21-day history for each stock
3. **Memory Inefficiency**: Stored unnecessary columns and used suboptimal data types
4. **No Caching**: Repeated API calls for same data
5. **Poor Error Handling**: Generic exception handling without retry logic

### Trading Bot Script (`hh`)
1. **Blocking API Operations**: Synchronous requests causing bottlenecks
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Referenced non-existent modules
3. **No Connection Pooling**: Created new connections for each request
4. **Linear Processing**: Sequential pair processing without concurrency
5. **No Rate Limiting**: Risk of hitting API limits
6. **Memory Leaks**: No cache management or cleanup

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Concurrency and Async Processing

#### Volume Screener
- **ThreadPoolExecutor**: Concurrent stock processing with configurable worker pool
- **Parallel API Calls**: Process up to 10 stocks simultaneously
- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout per stock to prevent hanging

```python
# Before: Sequential processing
for ticker in tickers:
    result = screen_stock(ticker)

# After: Concurrent processing
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=MAX_WORKERS) as executor:
    futures = {executor.submit(screen_stock_optimized, ticker): ticker for ticker in tickers}
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 5-10x faster execution (from ~20s to ~3s for 20 stocks)

#### Trading Bot
- **Full Async/Await**: Complete rewrite using asyncio
- **Connection Pooling**: Reusable HTTP connections with aiohttp
- **Semaphore-based Rate Limiting**: Control concurrent API requests
- **Async Context Managers**: Proper resource management

```python
# Before: Synchronous requests
response = requests.get(url)

# After: Async with connection pooling
async with session.get(url) as response:
    data = await response.json()
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 3-5x faster execution with better resource utilization

### 2. Caching Strategies

#### LRU Caching
- **Function-level Caching**: Cache expensive calculations and URL generation
- **Data Caching**: Cache API responses with TTL (Time-To-Live)
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cache cleanup to prevent memory leaks

```python
@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_date_range(days: int = LOOKBACK_DAYS + 1):
    """Cache date range calculation."""
    
# API response caching with TTL
if is_cache_valid(cache_key) and cache_key in _api_cache:
    return _api_cache[cache_key]
```

**Expected Performance Gain**: 50-80% reduction in redundant calculations and API calls

### 3. Memory Optimizations

#### Data Type Optimization
- **Reduced Column Sets**: Only fetch necessary columns from APIs
- **Optimal Data Types**: Use int64/float32 instead of default types
- **Vectorized Operations**: Use NumPy for faster mathematical operations

```python
# Before: Full dataset with default types
df = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date)

# After: Optimized columns and types
df = stock.history(start=start_date, end=end_date, actions=False, auto_adjust=False)
df = df[['Volume', 'Close']].copy()
df['Volume'] = df['Volume'].astype('int64')
df['Close'] = df['Close'].astype('float32')
```

**Expected Memory Reduction**: 40-60% reduction in RAM usage

#### Vectorized Processing
- **Pandas Operations**: Use vectorized operations for filtering
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple items in batches
- **Early Exit Conditions**: Stop processing when conditions aren't met

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience

#### Retry Logic
- **Exponential Backoff**: Retry failed requests with increasing delays
- **Timeout Management**: Prevent indefinite waiting
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue processing other items if one fails

```python
for attempt in range(RETRY_ATTEMPTS):
    try:
        # API call
        break
    except Exception as e:
        if attempt == RETRY_ATTEMPTS - 1:
            logger.error(f"Failed after {RETRY_ATTEMPTS} attempts")
        time.sleep(0.1 * (attempt + 1))  # Exponential backoff
```

#### Comprehensive Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Detailed performance metrics and error tracking
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time feedback on processing status
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track cache usage and memory consumption

### 5. Database Optimizations

#### Batch Operations
- **Bulk Inserts**: Batch database operations to reduce overhead
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections
- **Memory-efficient Batching**: Process data in configurable batch sizes

```python
# Before: Individual inserts
insert_token(**token_data)

# After: Batch processing
def insert_token(self, **kwargs):
    self.batch_data.append(kwargs)
    if len(self.batch_data) >= self.batch_size:
        self.flush_batch()
```
